TO DO:

1) NEED TO RESTRUCTURE THE FOLDER...IT SHOULD BE PHILIP-INTERN-PROJECT/PHILIP#[0-9999], NOT /PHILIP#[0-9999].

2) NEED TO FIX PHILIP JSON - SPACES REMOVED FROM METADATA.

3) I SHOULD ALSO CLEAN UP JSON FILES--HAVE ONE VERSION FOR LISTING PAGE, ANOTHER FOR NFT PAGE TO LIGHTEN SIZE.

NOTES:

IT MAY MAKE MORE SENSE TO JUST LEVERAGE V3 JSON FOR PHILIPS ON THE /PHILIP PAGE, SINCE INDEX === ID.
